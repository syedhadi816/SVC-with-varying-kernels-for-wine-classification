The following models were implemented and compared:
1. Multinomial Naive Bayes
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes
3. KNN
4. Support Vector Classifier with Varying Kernels
5. Ensemble Random Forest

The following attributes are used are predictors:
1) Alcohol
2) Malic acid
3) Ash
4) Alcalinity of ash  
5) Magnesium
6) Total phenols
7) Flavanoids
8) Nonflavanoid phenols
9) Proanthocyanins
10) Color intensity
11) Hue
12) OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
13) Proline
